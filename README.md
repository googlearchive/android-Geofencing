Android Geofencing Sample
===================================

When the user enters the vicinity of the Android building (B44) or the Yerba Buena
Gardens near the Moscone center in San Francisco, a notification silently appears on their
wearable with an option to check in. This notification automatically disappears when they leave
the area, and reappears the next time they are at one of these locations.

Introduction
------------

Geofencing combines awareness of the user's current location with awareness of
nearby features, defined as the user's proximity to locations that may be of
interest. To mark a location of interest, you specify its latitude and longitude.
To adjust the proximity for the location, you add a radius. The latitude,
longitude, and radius define a geofence. You can have multiple active
geofences at one time.

To use geofencing, start by defining the geofences you want to monitor.
Although you usually store geofence data in a local database or download
it from the network, you need to send a geofence to Location Services as
an instance of [Geofence][2], which you create with `Geofence.Builder`. Each
Geofence object contains the following information:

1. Latitude, longitude, and radius
2. Expiration time
3. Transition type
4. Geofence ID

Read more about geofences in [Creating and Monitoring Geofences][1].
